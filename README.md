A todo list website is an online tool designed to help individuals organize and prioritize their tasks, projects, and daily responsibilities. Users can create task lists, set deadlines, and receive reminders to stay on track with their goals. This website can help users increase productivity, reduce stress, and achieve a sense of accomplishment by providing a centralized location to manage their to-dos. Some todo list websites may also offer additional features such as collaboration, file sharing, and integration with other productivity tools.
